# Next Mind Synth

#### Version 0.1

This project uses a [NextMind](https://www.next-mind.com/) as a means of playing music with your mind.
It features:

* Single Scale NeuroTags arranged in an eight-note scale. The root, and common mode can be changed.
* Square, Sawtooth, and Sine wave oscillation.
* Drones that match the current scale's key note
* An OSC output
* A sample Max Patch that converts OSC to MIDI

## Instructions

The project uses several assets from the Unity asset store. Feel free to fork and disregard the visual but it
does require the NextMind SDK for minimum functionality.
